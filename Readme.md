# Text to Speech

Hey this project takes advantage of a server to run compute some audio file from text you send it.
Its built in a way that supports quick changes on both the server and client side. 
I think a fun next step would be setting it up with twilio to play the audio fiiles out when a number is called.

I'll try and clean it up this weekend and add some documentation.
